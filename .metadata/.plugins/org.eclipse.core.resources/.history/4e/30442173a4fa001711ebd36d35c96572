# The pattern
x, y, z = [1, 2, 3]

# also works in loops:
Gunnar = [(28, 'M',"Braveman"), (4, 'a','Tull'), (1990, 'r','kom igjen')]
for x, y, z in Gunnar:
    print(z)  # prints the numbers 28, 4, 1990

# and also
for index, (x, y,z) in enumerate(Gunnar):
    print(z,x)  # prints the numbers 28, 4, 1990
